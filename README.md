# 🏢Data Analysis of HDB Flats in Singapore🏢
I am an international student who studies in Polytechnic and decides to take tuition grant. Upon my graduation, I need to work for 3 years in Singapore to fulfill my bond. I am trying to look for a place to stay in the long run for about 10 years but there are some factors that I am confused about.
Firstly, I am looking a flat that is 'value for money' which means that flats have lots of amenities at a reasonable price with decent and strategic location which means easy to go anywhere.
Secondly, I am planning to move in in January 2024 with my brother. So i am hoping to have the right amount of room for us to stay. 
Thirdly, I am confused whether to buy or rent
 Help me to decide whether should i buy or rent , the location, and the flat type!

# 📝Summary
In Summary, from the analysis that we did, it is better for me to rent a flat if I want to live for about 10 years in Singapore. 
The best location is Central Area because even though it has relatively high median rent price , it has the highest average number of amenities and strategic location which allows me to go anywhere (especially working area) easily which is in line with my criteria.
Lastly, the most suitable room is 3-room since it has the most availability in central area and my brother and I can have our own room. 
THANK YOU!!
